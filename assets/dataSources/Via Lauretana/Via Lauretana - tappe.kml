<p>Informazioni essenziali

Distanza: 30 km
Durata: 7h 45'
Difficoltà: 3

Salita accumulata: 873 m
Discesa accumulata: 985 m</p>
<p>Da Pontelatrave a San Marcello

L'itinerario della variante per Camerino coincide con quello passante per Polverina, fino al convento di San Francesco di Pontelatrave, oltrepassato il quale, imboccata la strada di destra, dopo 320 m svolti a sinistra anziché proseguire diritto verso il lago. Da qui si impone al tuo sguardo la mole poderosa del castello di Beldiletto, antico fortilizio dei Da Varano fatto costruire da Giovanni nella seconda metà del '300, che Giulio Cesare trasformò in residenza nel XV secolo. Dopo 280 m si trova un ponte romanico: innalzato nel XIV secolo su fondamenta romane, testimonia la funzione di crocevia svolta da Pievebovigliana, nel medioevo come nell'età moderna; presso la frazione di Pontelatrave confluivano infatti i vari tracciati che attraverso la dorsale appenninica giungevano dal sud d'Italia, passando per Norcia e Visso.

Giunto ormai all'incrocio con la strada Statale 77, sul lato destro, in direzione di Macerata, si trova lo stabile già adibito a casa della posta, nel XIX secolo gestito dalla famiglia Cianni. Da qui, dopo appena 260 m sulla Statale, svolti a sinistra ed ancora a sinistra al bivio seguente: è questa la scorciatoia per San Marcello, piccola frazione del Comune di Camerino, che raggiungi in 2,80 km; la strada tuttavia ti consente di sfiorare l'abitato senza entrarvi.

Da San Marcello a Camerino

Dalla frazione di San Marcello Sali in località Cignanello fino all'incrocio con la strada Provinciale 132 che, con prudenza, prendi a sinistra e che abbandoni dopo 620 m svoltando a destra nella strada sterrata di collegamento con via Conti di Statte; attraversata quest'ultima, prosegui nella prospiciente via arano, quindi oltrepassi via Baudana Vaccolini e tiri dritto lungo borgo San Giorgio, superando anche viale Seneca fino in via Leopardi. Allora giri a sinistra imboccando la strada Provinciale 18 che in 400 m ti conduce davanti alla porta Malatesta, da cui accedi al centro storico di Camerino: sul lato sinistro, dopo 70 m, scorgi la piccola chiesa di San Giacomo, cui era annesso un hospitalis documentato già nel 1395.

CURIOSITÀ: dalla chiesa di San Giacomo, imboccando sulla destra via Battista, puoi raggiungere piazza della Vittoria dalla quale si accede ai giardini pubblici, ricavanti in realtà nel 1872 sul luogo del fossato della vicina rocca fatta costruire da Cesare Borgia; qui, presso il mastio, Clemente VII fece nascondere il tesoro della Santa Casa di Loreto per porlo in salvo dai pirati che infestavano l'Addriatico.

In Camerino

Camminando lungo via di S. Giacomo, giungi in piazza Santa Maria in Via, antistante al santuario che, ricostruito tra il 1639 ed il 1642 per volontà del cardinale Angelo Giori su progetto di Camillo Arcucci, allievo del Bernini, accoglie l'icona della Madonna col Bambino, del 1350, che la tradizione vuole portata dai Crociati provenienti da Smirne.

Poi prendi a destra via Pieragostini, quindi a sinistra in via Lili; quando questa confluisce in via XX Settembre, girà di nuovo a destra in corso Emanuele II, sfiorando il palazzo Bongiovanni, fino al 1571 residenza del Vescovo e ora sede del Comune e pervenendo in piazza Cavour, sulla quale si erge la statua bronzea di Sisto V, realizzata nel 1587 da Tiburzio Vergelli, e sulla quale prospettano la cattedrale della Santissima Annunziata, il Palazzo arcivescovile ed il Palazzo ducale.

APPROFONDIMENTO: il Palazzo ducale fu residenza dei Da Varano, eretto nel XIII secolo ed in seguito ampliato a più riprese, l'ultima delle quali, attribuita a Baccio Pontelli, risale al XV secolo, sotto la signoria di Giulio Cesare; posteriore è l'odierno Palazzo arcivescovile, costruito nel seconda metà del '500, forse su progetto del Vignola.

La Cattedrale, nella sua configurazione attuale, è frutto della ricostruzione operata d Andrea Vici, e Clemente Folchi per ciò che concerne la facciata, in seguito al terremoto del 1799 che aveva gravemente danneggiato la fabbrica duecentesca; presso la cripta, racchiuse in un'arca gotica, si venerano le reliquie di San Ansovino che fu vescovo di Camerino nel IX secolo.

Dalla piazza prendi a destra via Veneziani, poi diritto in via Ridolfini che ti porta fino all'ex convento di San Domenico, che fu fondato dopo il sacco svevo del 1259, scendendo la rampa che svolta a sinistra e girando a destra in corrispondenza dell'incrocio con via Betti. Qui prendi via Antinori, la seconda a destra, che ti conduce in piazza San Venanzio, sulla quale si affaccia la basilica.

APPROFONDIMENTO: della primitiva chiesa gotica, ad oggi, restano la facciata, il pronao ed il campanile, poiché il resto della fabbrica fu infatti riedificato nel XIX secolo sui disegni di Luigi Poletti; la cripta custodisce le reliquie del Santo.

Dalla piazza entri nella strada Provinciale 18, in direzione nord, fino alla porta San Giovanni, superata la quale, dopo 50 m, si apre il vicolo dei Fabbri, in lieve salita, che si snoda fra le case e che in 70 m arriva al monastero delle Clarisse, dove riposano le spoglie della Beata Camilla Battista da Varano e presso cui puoi trovare ospitalità.

Da Camerino a Valcimarra 

Continuando lungo la Provinciale 18, giungi all'incrocio con via Le Mosse che imbocchi a sinistra; prosegui diritto oltre la prima rotonda, poi prendi la prima uscita a destra alla rotonda successiva, ritornando sulla Provinciale 18. Dopo 1,40 km, sulla sinistra, puoi prendere la strada per il convento di Renacavata, sul luogo in cui in precedenza era situata una domus hospitalis e dove nel XVI secolo prese avvio la riforma dei Cappuccini.

Dopo altri 625 m sulla Provinciale 18 segue un altro bivio, con la strada Provinciale 22 che in 830 m ti conduce ai piedi della chiesa di San Gregorio di Dinazzano in cui si conserva in affresco cinquecentesco della Traslazione della Santa Casa. Continuando invece in direzione di Macerata, passati altri 230 m, svolta a sinistra la strada per Piedilapiaggia, in discesa, con la quale raggiungi il fondovalle: a circa 2,30 km dal bivio si trova l'ex complesso ospitaliero con la chiesa, oggi abitazione privata, che fondò nella seconda metà del '400 Venanzio di Giovanni, eremita di Statte. Dopo ulteriori 2,70 km la strada confluisce nella Statale 77 presso Campolarzo, frazione del Comune di Caldarola. Da qui l'itinerario coincide con quello che passa invece per Polverina.</p>

				<text><![CDATA[<h3><b>In Assisi</b></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Il pellegrinaggio ha inizio presso la trecentesca porta di San Pietro, accesso sud-occidentale della città di Assisi, non lontano dall'omonima chiesa abaziale che fu fondata dai Benedettini tra il X e l'XI secolo, poi riedificata agli inizi del '200. Appena oltrepassato il varco, svolta a sinistra in piaggia di Porta San Pietro ed arriva in piazza Bonghi, a ridosso delle porta di San Francesco che è parte dell'ampliamento murario trecentesco. Continuando in via Frate Elia giungi in piazza San Francesco sulla quale si affaccia l'ingresso della Basilica inferiore: qui, prima di lasciare Assisi, puoi venerare il corpo del Poverello, custodito nella cripta.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Girando a destra in via San Francesco, la medievale via Superba di collegamento con la piazza del Comune, dopo 120m dalla fine della rampa trovi sulla sinistra la loggia dei Maestri Comacini, eretta nel XIII secolo ma rimaneggiata nel '400, cui segue il palazzo Giacobetti, attribuito a Giacomo Giorgetti. Sul lato opposto sta l'oratorio dei Pellegrini, costruito nel 1457 come cappella dell'ospedale tenuto dalla Confraternita dei Santi Giacomo e Antonio abate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">APPROFONDIMENTO: la facciata dell'Oratorio presenta un Redentore in gloria tra i Santi patroni, di Matteo da Gualdo, che in realtà realizzò anche parte degli affreschi conservati all'interno, altri dei quali sono di Pier Antonio Mezzastris e dell'Ingegno.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Passati 90m puoi osservare il portico del Monte Frumentario, con i suoi sette archi ribassati, sul sito del più antico ospedale pubblico della città, fondato nel 1267 ed adibito ad istituto di credito agricolo nel XVIII secolo; accanto sta la fonte detta Oliviera, perché fatta costruire da Oliviero Lodovici nel 1570.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Superato l'arco del Seminario, o portella di Panzo, entri nella città di origine romana; nel '700 il vicino monastero benedettino di Sant'Angelo di Panzo (1270) fu convertito in Seminario vescovile, che scorgi sulla destra. La strada, che cambia toponimo in via Fortini, oltrepassa la piazzetta Verdi col teatro Metastasio (1836) e ricalcando un pre-esistente tracciato romano si congiunge con via Giotto e prosegue in via Portica, al termine della quale è collocata la fonte di San Niccolò, rifatta nel 1926.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">APPROFONDIMENTO: al di sopra della fonte, detta anche Portica, fino al 1926, quando vi fu costruito il palazzo delle Poste, si trovava la cripta di San Niccolò, documentata fin dal 1097; il luogo era caro alla tradizione francescana poiché, secondo la Leggenda dei tre compagni, qui San Francesco insieme a Bernardo da Quintavalle una mattina del 1209, interrogando per tre volte il Vangelo, ebbe confermata la sua vocazione. Al di sopra dell'ultima dell'arcata si erge un'edicola all'interno del quale si conserva una Madonna del Popolo ascrivibile alla scuola di Simone Martini.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Procedi dunque attraverso la piazza del Comune, lasciando sulla sinistra la duecentesca torre del Popolo col palazzo del Capitano (1282) e la chiesa di Santa Maria sopra Minerva, ricavata sulle strutture di un tempio del I secolo a.C.; passi quindi tra la fontana dei Tre leoni, sostituzione settecentesca del primigenio manufatto del '300, ed il palazzo dei Priori (1275-1493), sulla destra, entrando così in corso Mazzini.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Svoltando immediatamente a sinistra puoi raggiungere in breve la chiesa Nuova, eretta nel 1615 sulla casa paterna del Poverello, a spese di Filippo III re di Spagna; all'interno è inoltre custodito il così detto carcere di San Francesco, dove il Santo, vuole la tradizione, fu rinchiuso da Pietro di Bernardone. Proseguendo a sinistra del tempio, incontri l'oratorio di San Francesco piccolino, che sorge su una stalla nella quale, si tramanda, Giovanna Pica, consigliata da un pellegrino, si rifugiò per partorire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Continuando invece lungo corso Mazzini, varchi la portella di San Giorgio, costruzione medievale in luogo di una più antica porta romana, avanzi in via Santa Chiara, ampliata e ammattonata nel '300, pervenendo all'omonima piazza antistante alla Basilica; la fontana posta al centro dello spazio è del 1872.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">APPROFONDIMENTO: la basilica di Santa Chiara sorge sul sedime sulla chiesetta e dell'ospedale di San Giorgio, noti fin dal 1111. Secondo la Leggenda dei tre compagni San Francesco, fanciullo, frequentò la scuola annessa all'oratorio; qui fu tumulato il suo corpo all'indomani della morte ed avvenne la canonizzazione nel 1228. La fabbrica attuale fu iniziata nel 1257 e nel 1260 vi furono condotte le spoglie della Santa, deceduta presso San Damiano nel 1253. Nel 1260 la chiesa fu consacrata da Clemente IV. Nella cappella delle Reliquie si venera il crocefisso, dipinto su tavola alla fine del XII secolo, che parlò al Serafico, mentre nella cripta, ricavata tra il 1850 e il 1872 e rimaneggiata nel 1935, è l'urna col corpo della Santa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A lei è intitolata anche la porta duecentesca che ti immette in via Borgo Aretino, quest'ultimo sviluppatosi in concomitanza degli ampliamenti urbani del XIV secolo, e con la quale arrivi alla porta Nuova, eretta nel '300; appena prima scorgi la via che, discendendo sulla destra, conduce alle fonti di Moiano, note fin dal XII secolo per la salubrità delle acque.</p>
<h3><b>Da Assisi a Spello</b></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oltrepassata la porta Nuova, dopo 55 m prendi a destra la strada Statale 444; giunto alla rotatoria, prosegui diritto in via Madonna dell'Olivo che percorri per 230 m, quindi imbocchi a sinistra via San Benedetto. Quando la strada, superati gli impianti sportivi, si sdoppia, prendi il diverticolo a destra che dopo 590 m interseca via Fosso delle Carceri e prosegue oltre. Al secondo bivio, prendendo a sinistra, puoi collegarti con la strada Provinciale 251 e raggiungere in 2,7 km l'abazia di San Benedetto al Subasio, documentata dall'XI secolo ma di origini remote, dal '200 importante sede monastica dipendente da Farfa; a destra invece continui in via Borghetaccio, attraversi via San Vitale ed entri in via Fonte l'Abate per poi mantenerti a sinistra al primo bivio, rispettivamente centrale, a sinistra e di nuovo centrale ai tre trivi seguenti, quindi ancora a sinistra al bivio successivo.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dopo 1,0 km, quando la strada ha preso il toponimo di via del Gabbiano, raggiungi un ampio complesso edilizio rurale, superato il quale svolti a destra dopo 90 m, ancora in via del Gabbiano, quindi a sinistra al bivio che segue. Il tracciato avanza sinuoso verso sud, poi confluisce in via Renano, divenendo più lineare fino a congiungersi con via degli Ulivi che prendi a sinistra, entrando nel Comune di Spello. Costeggiato per 3,00 km il monte Subasio, arrivi all'incrocio con via Poeta che imbocchi a sinistra e con la quale pervieni in breve alla porta Montanara, di accesso al paese.</p>]]></text>

<p style="text-align:justify;">APPROFONDIMENTO: al di sopra della fonte, detta anche Portica, fino al 1926, quando vi fu costruito il palazzo delle Poste, si trovava la cripta di San Niccolò, documentata fin dal 1097; il luogo era caro alla tradizione francescana poiché, secondo la Leggenda dei tre compagni, qui San Francesco insieme a Bernardo da Quintavalle una mattina del 1209, interrogando per tre volte il Vangelo, ebbe confermata la sua vocazione. Al di sopra dell'ultima dell'arcata si erge un'edicola all'interno del quale si conserva una Madonna del Popolo ascrivibile alla scuola di Simone Martini.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Procedi dunque attraverso la piazza del Comune, lasciando sulla sinistra la duecentesca torre del Popolo col palazzo del Capitano (1282) e la chiesa di Santa Maria sopra Minerva, ricavata sulle strutture di un tempio del I secolo a.C.; passi quindi tra la fontana dei Tre leoni, sostituzione settecentesca del primigenio manufatto del '300, ed il palazzo dei Priori (1275-1493), sulla destra, entrando così in corso Mazzini.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Svoltando immediatamente a sinistra puoi raggiungere in breve la chiesa Nuova, eretta nel 1615 sulla casa paterna del Poverello, a spese di Filippo III re di Spagna; all'interno è inoltre custodito il così detto carcere di San Francesco, dove il Santo, vuole la tradizione, fu rinchiuso da Pietro di Bernardone. Proseguendo a sinistra del tempio, incontri l'oratorio di San Francesco piccolino, che sorge su una stalla nella quale, si tramanda, Giovanna Pica, consigliata da un pellegrino, si rifugiò per partorire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Continuando invece lungo corso Mazzini, varchi la portella di San Giorgio, costruzione medievale in luogo di una più antica porta romana, avanzi in via Santa Chiara, ampliata e ammattonata nel '300, pervenendo all'omonima piazza antistante alla Basilica; la fontana posta al centro dello spazio è del 1872.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">APPROFONDIMENTO: la basilica di Santa Chiara sorge sul sedime sulla chiesetta e dell'ospedale di San Giorgio, noti fin dal 1111. Secondo la Leggenda dei tre compagni San Francesco, fanciullo, frequentò la scuola annessa all'oratorio; qui fu tumulato il suo corpo all'indomani della morte ed avvenne la canonizzazione nel 1228. La fabbrica attuale fu iniziata nel 1257 e nel 1260 vi furono condotte le spoglie della Santa, deceduta presso San Damiano nel 1253. Nel 1260 la chiesa fu consacrata da Clemente IV. Nella cappella delle Reliquie si venera il crocefisso, dipinto su tavola alla fine del XII secolo, che parlò al Serafico, mentre nella cripta, ricavata tra il 1850 e il 1872 e rimaneggiata nel 1935, è l'urna col corpo della Santa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A lei è intitolata anche la porta duecentesca che ti immette in via Borgo Aretino, quest'ultimo sviluppatosi in concomitanza degli ampliamenti urbani del XIV secolo, e con la quale arrivi alla porta Nuova, eretta nel '300; appena prima scorgi la via che, discendendo sulla destra, conduce alle fonti di Moiano, note fin dal XII secolo per la salubrità delle acque.</p>
<h3><b>Da Assisi a Spello</b></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oltrepassata la porta Nuova, dopo 55 m prendi a destra la strada Statale 444; giunto alla rotatoria, prosegui diritto in via Madonna dell'Olivo che percorri per 230 m, quindi imbocchi a sinistra via San Benedetto. Quando la strada, superati gli impianti sportivi, si sdoppia, prendi il diverticolo a destra che dopo 590 m interseca via Fosso delle Carceri e prosegue oltre. Al secondo bivio, prendendo a sinistra, puoi collegarti con la strada Provinciale 251 e raggiungere in 2,7 km l'abazia di San Benedetto al Subasio, documentata dall'XI secolo ma di origini remote, dal '200 importante sede monastica dipendente da Farfa; a destra invece continui in via Borghetaccio, attraversi via San Vitale ed entri in via Fonte l'Abate per poi mantenerti a sinistra al primo bivio, rispettivamente centrale, a sinistra e di nuovo centrale ai tre trivi seguenti, quindi ancora a sinistra al bivio successivo.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dopo 1,0 km, quando la strada ha preso il toponimo di via del Gabbiano, raggiungi un ampio complesso edilizio rurale, superato il quale svolti a destra dopo 90 m, ancora in via del Gabbiano, quindi a sinistra al bivio che segue. Il tracciato avanza sinuoso verso sud, poi confluisce in via Renano, divenendo più lineare fino a congiungersi con via degli Ulivi che prendi a sinistra, entrando nel Comune di Spello. Costeggiato per 3,00 km il monte Subasio, arrivi all'incrocio con via Poeta che imbocchi a sinistra e con la quale pervieni in breve alla porta Montanara, di accesso al paese.</p>]]></text>
