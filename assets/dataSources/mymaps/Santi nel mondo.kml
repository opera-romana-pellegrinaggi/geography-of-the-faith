        <description><![CDATA[Church of St Anne <br>91190 Jerusalem, Israel <br><br>*Formerly this church was called St Mary in Probatica. <br>*Tradition claims that this church rests over the house of Saints Joachim and Anne. Thus it is presumed that the Blessed Virgin Mary was born here. The crypt below this church honors this tradition. Also located just outside of this church is the Pool of Bethesda where Jesus healed a man who had been ill for thirty-eight years. <br>*Historically the tombs of Saints Joachim and Anne have also been thought to rest below this church. However, at present this tradition is not noted in the church.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[According to the tradition of the Armenian Apostolic Church, Saint Thaddeus, also known as Saint Jude, (not to be confused with Judas Iscariot), evangelized the region of Armenia and Persia. Thaddeus suffered martyrdom in Armenia, according to the same tradition, and is revered as an apostle of the Armenian Church. Legend has it that a church dedicated to him was first built on the present site in AD 68.<br>In July 2008, the Monastery of Saint Thaddeus was added to UNESCO's World Heritage List, along with two other Armenian monuments in the same province: the Monastery of Saint Stepanos and the Chapel of Dzordzor.<br><br>According to Armenian Church tradition, the Apostles Thaddeus and Bartholomew traveled through Armenia in AD 45 to preach the word of God, where many people were converted and numerous secret Christian communities were established.<br><br>The ancient Christian historian Moses of Khorene told the following story, considered a legend by most modern historiographers. Thaddeus converted King Abgar V of Edessa. After his death, the Armenian kingdom was split into two parts. His son Ananun crowned himself in Edessa, while his nephew Sanatruk ruled in Armenia. About AD 66, Ananun gave the order to kill Saint Thaddeus in Edessa. The king's daughter Sandokht, who had converted to Christianity, was martyred with Thaddeus. Her tomb is said to be located near the Qara Kelisa.]]></description>

        <name>San Tito</name>
        <description><![CDATA[Nella chiesa di San Tito a Candia sull'isola di Creta si venera il suo cranio.<br><br>Fu uno dei piÃ¹ stretti collaboratori di Paolo di Tarso, che gli indirizzÃ² una delle sue lettere pastorali. Secondo la tradizione fu vescovo di Creta.<br>Tito Ã¨ noto solo attraverso le lettere di Paolo, in quanto gli Atti degli Apostoli non lo menzionano. Ã anche il destinatario della Lettera a Tito, che perÃ², insieme alle altre due lettere pastorali (le due lettere a Timoteo), Ã¨ considerata pseudoepigrafa (cioÃ¨ non scritta da Paolo sebbene l'autore affermi di esserlo) dai critici modernisti mentre Ã¨ considerata autentica da tutti gli studiosi di orientamento conservatore.<br><br>Greco di origine pagana, venne probabilmente convertito al cristianesimo dallo stesso Paolo. Gli fu frequentemente vicino durante tutti i suoi viaggi, particolarmente nei difficili rapporti con l'irrequieta comunitÃ  di Corinto.<br><br>Attorno al 50 accompagnÃ² Barnaba e Paolo al concilio di Gerusalemme per discutere con gli apostoli circa la libertÃ  dell'adesione alla legge giudaica per i nuovi convertiti di origine pagana.<br><br>Durante il terzo viaggio missionario, fu inviato da Paolo a Corinto quale messaggero di pace, per ristabilire l'armonia fra i cristiani della cittÃ  e l'Apostolo (2 Cor 2,13; 7,6).Â Successivamente, ebbe anche l'incarico di organizzare la colletta per i poveri in Gerusalemme in quella stessa comunitÃ  (2 Cor 8,6-17).<br><br>Il rapporto tra Paolo e Tito appare improntato all'amicizia fraterna, cementato da una comunanza di sentimenti, di spirito, di cuore. In 2 Cor 2,12-13 Paolo, recatosi a Troas per predicarvi la parola di Dio, non trova vera consolazione - non ebbi pace nello spirito - perchÃ© non vi trova Tito.<br><br>Nelle lettere pastorali, Ã¨ definito dall'autore Â«vero figlio nella fede comuneÂ», e si dice che Tito era stato posto a guida della Chiesa di Creta, per poi andare in seguito in Epiro, a Nicopoli, e in Dalmazia.]]></description>

        <description>Una delle figure piÃ¹ feconde della CristianitÃ  delle origini Ã¨, senza dubbio, Santa Nino, fra le prime coraggiose testimoni della fede in Cristo a cui le Cronache attribuiscono la conversione della Georgia, Stato plurisecolare oggi indipendente dopo settantâanni di dominio sovietico. Secondo le sue fonti agiografiche piÃ¹ diffuse, era originaria di Colastra in Cappadocia e giunse in Georgia (lâantica Iberia) proveniente da Costantinopoli. Altre fonti la indicano come di Gerusalemme, di Roma, o gallica. Dopo aver compiuto diverse guarigioni miracolose convertÃ¬ dapprima la regina Nana e successivamente il re pagano Mirian III di Iberia che, perso in un bosco fitto ed immerso dalle tenebre durante una battuta di caccia, trovÃ² la strada della salvezza solo dopo aver invocato il âDio di Ninoâ. Mirian dichiarÃ² quindi il Cristianesimo religione ufficiale (c. 327) e Cristiana continuÃ² le proprie attivitÃ  missionarie tra i georgiani fino alla sua morte. La sua tomba Ã¨ ancora presente nel monastero di Bodbe a Kakheti, nella Georgia orientale e uno dei suoi attributi, la croce di tralci di vite, e il simbolo della cristianitÃ  georgiana.Â </description>

        <description><![CDATA[Nellâodierna Sivas, ricca di monumenti risalenti perlopiÃ¹ alla dominazione selgiuchide (sec. XIII), nulla resta del suo piÃ¹ remoto passato.<br><br>Sotto Diocleziano Sebaste assurse a metropoli dellâArmenia Prima (fine III secolo) e con Giustiniano (527-565) che ne restaurÃ² le mura, fu eretta a capitale dellâArmenia Seconda. Quantunque da un punto di vista archeologico Sebaste non presenti alcun interesse, non si puÃ² dire altrettanto per le memorie cristiane scritte.<br><br>40 soldati appartenenti alla legione Fulminata furono arrestati perchÃ© cristiani e posti nellâalternativa di apostatare o di subire la morte. Ora in questo tempo Sebaste era metropoli dellâArmenia. Le nostre conoscenze si ampliano a partire dalla persecuzione di Licinio (320-324). In quel tempo 40 soldati appartenenti alla legione Fulminata furono arrestati perchÃ© cristiani e posti nellâalternativa di apostatare o di subire la morte. Rimasti fedeli alla loro fede, vennero condannati alla crudele pena di essere esposti nudi ai rigori del gelo invernale particolarmente pungente in questa regione.Â Il martirio ebbe luogo il 9 di marzo nel cortile del ginnasio annesso alle terme della cittÃ . Melezio, forse il capo del gruppo, apostatÃ² ma il suo posto venne preso dal custode delle terme. Dal prezioso documento che Ã¨ il Testamento dei 40 martiri, apprendiamo che allora, nei piccoli paesi dellâArmenia, il cristianesimo di stampo ellenistico non era meno diffuso che in Cappadocia.<br><br>Forse ancora sotto Licinio, a Sebaste fu decapitato S. Biagio.Â  I suoi Atti, tardivi e leggendari, lo presentano come medico divenuto poi vescovo della cittÃ . Scoppiata la persecuzione, si nascose, ma venne catturato. Un giorno, una donna il cui figlio stava morendo a causa dâuna lisca di pesce conficcatasi in gola, lo visitÃ² in carcere e gli chiese aiuto. La benedizione di Biagio guarÃ¬ immediatamente il fanciullo. Questo, come altri episodi ricorrenti negli Atti, giustificano la larghissima diffusione del culto riservato a Biagio, assunto quale patrono contro i mali di gola e â a motivo dâun altro miracolo â come patrono del bestiame.<br><br>Sempre a Sebaste furono portate le reliquie di San Gregorio di Narek nel 1021; il villaggio dove furono deposte fu soprannominato Narek in ricordo del monastero dove San Gregorio aveva trascorso la sua vita.]]></description>

In 1220 AD several cardinals from Rome who were present for the translation of the body of St Thomas Becket from the crypt to the main floor of Canterbury Cathedral took several small relics of St Thomas Becket back to Italy. Upon the destruction of St Thomas Becketâs shrine in 1538 these relics remained of the saint. In the past two centuries some of these relics and others from around Europe have been returned to Canterbury. In the 19th century the church received from Gubbio, Italy both a piece of his vestment and a bone from his body. Then in 1953 the Prior of Chevetogne, Father Thomas Becquet, presented to this church a piece of St Thomas Becketâs finger.]]></description>

Nel 1021 le reliquie del santo furono trasferite a Sebaste, l'attuale Sivaz, nell'antica provincia dell'Armenia Minore nell'Anatolia centrale. Il villaggio dove furono deposte le reliquie fu poi soprannominato Narek in ricordo del monastero dove Gregorio aveva trascorso la sua vita.<br><br>Gregorio di Narek (in lingua armena: Ô³ÖÕ«Õ£Õ¸Ö ÕÕ¡ÖÕ¥Õ¯Õ¡ÖÕ«; 951 â 1003) Ã¨ stato un poeta, monaco cristiano, teologo e filosofo mistico armeno. Ã venerato come santo dalla Chiesa apostolica armena e dalla Chiesa cattolica; quest'ultima gli ha attribuito il titolo di dottore della Chiesa.<br><br>Gregorio di Narek nacque in una famiglia di scrittori. Suo padre, Khosrov, fu un arcivescovo. Avendo perso sua madre molto presto, fu educato da suo cugino, Anania di Narek, fondatore della scuola e del villaggio. Visse gran parte della sua vita nei monasteri di Narek (nella Grande Armenia, attualmente in Turchia) dove insegnava presso la scuola monastica. Fu uno dei piÃ¹ importanti poeti della storia della letteratura armena.<br><br>Martirologio Romano:<br>Â«Nel monastero di Narek in Armenia, san Gregorio, monaco, dottore degli Armeni, insigne per la dottrina, gli scritti e la scienza mistica.Â»<br><br>Il 21 febbraio 2015 papa Francesco ha confermato la sentenza affermativa della sessione plenaria dei cardinali e vescovi, membri della Congregazione delle cause dei santi, annunciando il prossimo conferimento del titolo di dottore della Chiesa a san Gregorio; la proclamazione a dottore della Chiesa Ã¨ avvenuta con apposita lettera apostolica di papa Francesco il 12 aprile 2015, e annunciata solennemente lo stesso giorno durante la celebrazione nella Basilica di San Pietro in occasione del centenario del genocidio degli armeni. Gregorio Ã¨ il 36Â° Dottore della Chiesa proclamato dalla Chiesa cattolica.<br><br>Lo stesso papa il 25 gennaio 2021 ne ha istituito la memoria facoltativa per tutta la Chiesa universale, fissandola al 27 febbraio.<br><br>Non solo per la sua dottrina, ma anche per la capacitÃ  poeta Gregorio di Narek Ã¨ un modello per la poesia armena di ogni tempo. Nel XX e XI secolo con la riscoperta della mistica nella poesia armena egli Ã¨ ritornato ad essere un modello e un esempio per molti poeti che lo hanno citato piÃ¹ o meno velatamente nella loro opera. Tra cui coloro che lo hanno preso maggiormente ad esempio ricordiamo il poeta Hrand Nazariantz e la poetessa Anahit Ghazakhetsyan.]]></description>

The imperial decision was implemented on a lot that had been recently confiscated from a disgraced eunuch, outside the Fuchengmen gate of the Beijing city fortifications.[2] A funeral ceremony was held on 22 April 1611, with a procession starting from the Jesuit premises where the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception now stands. Ricci's coffin stayed at the cemetery's chapel for several months until it was finally buried in November 1611.<br><br>Other Jesuits were buried on the ground in the ensuing years. In 1654, Johann Adam Schall von Bell obtained from the Shunzhi Emperor the authorization to extend the cemetery. Shall von Bell was himself buried there in 1666.<br><br>Following the Suppression of the Society of Jesus by the Holy See in 1773, the Lazarists took care of the cemetery, then the archimandrite of the Chinese Orthodox Church, then again the Catholic Church.<br><br>The cemetery was vandalized in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion, and the bones of the interred Jesuits were dispersed.[3] Its restoration, stipulated by the Boxer Protocol, included the brick framing of some of the delicately carved tombstones. At the same time a church dedicated to Mary was erected nearby (Maweigou Church, zh:é¦¬å°¾æºæå ).[2]<br><br>In the mid-1950s, remains including hundreds of tombstones were moved to the Xibeiwang area of Beijing (now the Catholic Cemetery, zh:åäº¬å¤©ä¸»æéµå). A Communist Party of China school, now the Beijing Administration Institute, was established on the grounds. Because of their historical significance, however, the tombstones of Ricci, Johann Adam Schall von Bell and Ferdinand Verbiest were kept on the original ground. Other monumental tombstones were aligned against the Maweigou Church's wall.[4]<br><br>During the Cultural Revolution, the site was again targeted as a symbol of foreign domination. The Red Guards intended to destroy the tombstones, but a staff member of the party school persuaded them to bury them instead, which ensured their preservation. The Maweigou Church was demolished in 1974.[5]<br><br>In the late 1970s, Deng Xiaoping approved the restoration of Matteo Ricci's grave. The tombstones of Ricci, Schall von Bell and Verbiest were once again re-erected on what was believed to be their original locations. 60 additional original tombstones were re-erected in 1984 in a fenced section, of which 14 of Chinese converts and 46 of European missionaries.[2]<br><br>Jean-Luc Dehaene, ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, Sergio Mattarella, Giorgio Napolitano, Jorge Sampaio, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and MiloÅ¡ Zeman are among the foreign dignitaries who have visited the cemetery with their Chinese official hosts since.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[A native of Spain, this young Jesuit left his home in 1610 to spend the rest of his life doing mission work in present day Colombia, South America. He was ordained in 1616 in the port city of Cartagena. This city was a major port for the slave trade. An estimated ten thousand slaves from West Africa were brought through there annually. This young priest was so dedicated to the plight of the slaves that he would meet them, often running through the water to board the ship and provide medicine, food and with the help of interpreters encouragement. During his ministry it is thought that he ministered to over three hundred thousand slaves. At his death, the city fathers, who had often frowned upon his work, paid for a large funeral honoring him for his lifelong ministry. He was canonized in 1888. He is known as the âSlave of Slavesâ.<br><br>Iglesia de San Pedro Claver<br>(Church of St Peter Claver)<br>Carrera 4<br>Cartagena, Bolivar, Colombia<br><br>*The remains of St Peter Claver (d. 1654) rest under the main altar of this church. For forty years he attended to the many slaves who arrived in the city upon slave ships. Through his ministry he would offer at least a glimmer of hope and love before they were carted off to the auction blocks. It is estimated that during his life he baptized over 300,000 of these individuals.]]></description>

The first Christians to be martyred here were the 26 saints of Japan, and among the later martyrs was Saint Lorenzo Ruiz, the first Filipino Christian martyr.<br><br>The 26 saints of Japan were crucified here in the year 1597. They included missionaries from Spain, Portugal and Mexico, as well as Japanese Christians (including three children). They were crucified on this hill at the request Portuguese residents in Nagasaki at the time, who did not wish them to be executed in the same place that common criminals usually were. In his record of the event, the Jesuit missionary Luis Frois wrote that the hill resembled Golgotha (where Christ was crucified) because it had paths leading up it on either side.<br><br>After the end of the Second World War, as Nagasaki was rebuilt from the ruins of the atomic bomb, a park was made on Nishizaka hill, and in 1956 the hill was formally designated as an historical landmark by Nagasaki Prefecture. It had already been designated by Pope Pius XII as an official Catholic pilgrimage site in 1950.<br><br>On the hundredth anniversary of the canonisation of the 26 martyrs of Japan in Rome, a life-sized bronze sculpture of the 26 martyrs and an accompanying museum were built.

In 2015, as part of a set of events held to mark the 150th anniversary of the discovery of the Hidden Christians of Japan, statues of these 16 martyrs were built in the Japanese garden to the side of the church. On August 9th 1945, fires caused by the atomic bombing reduced the majority of the church to ruins, leaving only the spire and the outer wall still standing. In October 1951 the church was rebuilt incorporating the original spire and outer wall, and since then it has retained this form.</description>

Of Scottish descent, she was born in Melbourne but is best known for her activities in South Australia. Together with Julian Tenison-Woods, she founded the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart (the Josephites), a congregation of religious sisters that established a number of schools and welfare institutions throughout Australia and New Zealand, with an emphasis on education for the rural poor.<br><br>The process to have MacKillop declared a saint began in the 1920s, and she was beatified in January 1995 by Pope John Paul II. Pope Benedict XVI prayed at her tomb during his visit to Sydney for World Youth Day 2008 and in December 2009 approved the Catholic Church's recognition of a second miracle attributed to her intercession. She was canonised on 17 October 2010, during a public ceremony in St Peter's Square at the Vatican. She is the first Australian to be recognised by the Catholic Church as a saint. Mary MacKillop is the patron saint of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Peter Chanel (12 July 1803 â 28 April 1841), born Pierre Louis Marie Chanel, was a Catholic priest, missionary, and martyr.<br>In 1831, at the age of 28, Chanel joined the nascent Society of Mary (Marists), who would concentrate on local missions and foreign missionary work. Instead of selecting him as a missionary, however, the Marists appointed him as the spiritual director at the seminary of Belley, where he stayed for five years. In 1833, he accompanied Jean-Claude Colin to Rome to seek approval of the nascent Society. In 1836, the Marists were asked to send missionaries to the territory of the southwest Pacific. In return for eventual acceptance, the group were promised formal approbation, granted by Pope Gregory XVI. Chanel, professed with the other aspirants as Marist on 24 September 1836, was made the superior of theband of seven Marist missionaries that set out on 24 December from Le Havre. They were accompanied by Bishop Jean Baptiste Pompallier who was to become the first Roman Catholic bishop of New Zealand.<br><br>Chanel traveled first to the Canary Islands (8 January 1837), where his friend, Claude Bret, caught a flu-like virus which led to his death at sea (20 March 1837). Next, Chanel traveled to ValparaÃ­so, Chile (28 June), where the French Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary ("Picpus Fathers"), who had care of the Apostolic Vicariate of Eastern Oceania, had their base. His third and fourth stops were in the Gambier Islands (13 September) and in Tahiti (21 September), where the group transferred to the ship Raiatea. In that ship, they set sail (23 October) to drop off two missionaries at Wallis, the main seat of the mission in Tonga. The missionaries arrived at Vavaâu but were not welcome, and thus continued their journey to Futuna. Chanel went to neighboring Futuna, accompanied by a French lay brother Marie-Nizier Delorme. They arrived on 8 November 1837 with an English Protestant layman named Thomas Boag, who had been resident on the island and had joined them at Tonga seeking passage to Futuna.<br><br>The group was initially well received by Futuna's king, Niuliki. Chanel struggled to learn the language but eventually mastered it. Despite little apparent success and severe want, he maintained endless patience and courage. It was a difficult mission, requiring him to cope with isolation and acclimatise to different foods and customs, but it eventually began to bear some fruit. A few natives had been baptised while a few more were being instructed. King Niuliki believed Christianity would undermine his authority as high priest and king. When his son, Meitala, sought to be baptised, the king sent a favored warrior, his son-in-law, Musumusu, to "do whatever was necessary" to resolve the problem. Musumusu went to Meitala and the two fought. Musumusu, injured in the fracas, went to Chanel feigning need of medical attention. While Chanel tended him, a group of others ransacked his house. Musumusu took an ax and clubbed Chanel to death. Chanel died on 28 April 1841.]]></description>

A highly influential figure in Brazil's history in the first century after its European discovery, Anchieta was one of the founders of SÃ£o Paulo in 1554 and of Rio de Janeiro in 1565. He is the first playwright, the first grammarian and the first poet born in the Canary Islands, and the father of Brazilian literature. Anchieta was also involved in the religious instruction and conversion to the Catholic faith of the Indian population. His efforts along with those of another Jesuit missionary, Manuel da NÃ³brega, at Indian pacification were crucial to the establishment of stable colonial settlements in the colony.<br><br>With his book Arte de gramÃ¡tica da lingoa mais usada na costa do Brasil (1595, as Ioseph de Anchieta), Anchieta became the first person to provide an orthography to the Old Tupi language most commonly spoken by the indigenous people of Brazil.<br><br>Anchieta is commonly known as "the Apostle of Brazil". He was canonized by Pope Francis on 3 April 2014. He was the second native of the Canary Islands, after Peter of Saint Joseph Betancur, also a missionary to Latin America, declared a saint by the Catholic Church. Anchieta is also considered the third saint of Brazil.]]></description>

It was the setting of the Shimabara-Amakusa Rebellion, a peasant revolt, which took place in the Shimabara-Amakusa area and became a catalyst for the implementation of the sakoku (national seclusion) policy in Japan. A large amount of human bones and crucifixes have been discovered here. The Sakoku Edict, which was issued five times beginning in 1633, ended with the exclusion of the Portuguese in 1639, one year after the Shimabara-Amakusa Rebellion was suppressed.

        <description><![CDATA[Takashi Nagai (æ°¸äºé Nagai Takashi) (Matsue, 3 febbraio 1908 â Nagasaki, 1Âº maggio 1951) Ã¨ stato un medico giapponese, specializzato in radiologia, che si convertÃ¬ al cattolicesimo con il nome di Paolo e sopravvisse al bombardamento atomico di Nagasaki. La sua successiva vita di preghiera e di servizio gli ha fatto ottenere il soprannome di "Santo di Urakami".<br><br>Intraprende allora la lettura dei Pensieri, riflette sulla vita umana e cambia progressivamente. Diventa piÃ¹ sensibile. CosÃ¬, nel suo terzo anno di medicina, Ã¨ sorpreso dall'atteggiamento rigido dei professori quando vanno al capezzale dei malati.<br><br>Nel 1931, continuando la lettura di Pascal, si interroga sulla vita dei cristiani e sulla preghiera. Si interessa al cristianesimo, facendosi ospitare dalla famiglia Moriyama che, da sette generazioni, fa parte di un gruppo di "kakure kirishitan" (cristiani nascosti) del quartiere di Urakami. Sadakichi Moriyama vive con la sua sposa, mentre la loro figlia unica, Midori, fa la maestra in una cittÃ  vicina. Takashi apprende che la costruzione della cattedrale Ã¨ stata finanziata dai poveri contadini e pescatori cristiani giapponesi.<br><br>La sera del 24 dicembre Midori Moriyama lo invita a partecipare alla messa di mezzanotte. Nella cattedrale gremita Takashi Ã¨ colpito dai fedeli in preghiera, dai canti, dalla loro fede e dall'omelia. RacconterÃ : "ho sentito qualcuno vicino a me che non conoscevo ancora". La notte seguente Midori Ã¨ colpita da un attacco di appendicite acuta. Takashi fa una rapida diagnosi, avverte il chirurgo e porta Midori tra le sue braccia in ospedale, sotto la neve. L'operazione riesce e Midori si salva.<br><br>Il 9 giugno 1934 riceve il battesimo nella fede cattolica e sceglie il nome cristiano Paolo. Entra cosÃ¬ a far parte della comunitÃ  cattolica. Particolarmente significativa Ã¨ per lui la figura di san Paolo Miki. Poi chiede a Midori di sposarlo e lei accetta. Nell'agosto 1934, un mercoledÃ¬, alle 7 della mattina, durante la prima messa nella cattedrale di Urakami, il loro matrimonio Ã¨ celebrato in presenza del presbitero e di due testimoni. Maria Midori Moriyama e Paolo Takashi Nagai intraprendono insieme la loro vita cristiana: Midori Ã¨ presidentessa dell'associazione delle donne del quartiere di Urakami, Takashi diventa membro della SocietÃ  San Vincenzo De Paoli, scoprendo gli scritti del suo fondatore, Federico Ozanam. Visita i malati e i piÃ¹ poveri, portando loro conforto e aiuti alimentari. Della loro unione nascono quattro bambini: un maschio, Makoto (3 aprile 1935 â 4 aprile 2001), e tre femmine, Ikuko (7 luglio 1937 â 1939), Sasano, che muore poco dopo la nascita, e Kayano (nata nel 1941). Takashi riceve il sacramento della confermazione nel dicembre 1934.<br><br>Dal 1931 al 1936 il frate Massimiliano Kolbe risiede in un sobborgo di Nagasaki, dove fonda un monastero. Takashi lo incontra diverse volte.<br><br>Nel 1945, quando la seconda bomba atomica lanciata dagli Stati Uniti colpisce Nagasaki, Takashi sopravvive ma sua moglie muore.Â Per i cinquantotto giorni seguenti Nagai continua a curare le vittime della bomba atomica e a insegnare all'universitÃ  di Nagasaki.Â Si trasferisce nel quartiere di Urakami, quello dell'ipocentro della bomba, il 15 ottobre 1945. Fa costruire una piccola capanna, da pazienti riconoscenti e dai suoi allievi, fatta coi pezzi della sua vecchia casa. Denominata "Nyoko-dÅ" ("Amate gli altri come voi stessi", secondo le parole di GesÃ¹ "amerai il tuo prossimo come te stesso").]]></description>
